> Having access to private methods inside public methods in a module or class offers several advantages in terms of code organization, security, and maintainability:

## Encapsulation and Information Hiding:

By allowing access to private methods only within public methods, you enforce a level of encapsulation and information hiding. Users of the module or class are exposed to a well-defined public interface, while the internal implementation details are kept private.

## Control Over Internal State:

By restricting access to private methods, you maintain control over the internal state and behavior of the module or class. Users can only interact with the exposed public methods, ensuring that the internal state remains consistent and valid.

## Security and Validation:

Private methods can be used to perform security checks or validation before or after invoking public methods. This ensures that operations performed by public methods adhere to certain rules or constraints, providing a layer of security and preventing misuse.

## Flexibility in Implementation:

Private methods can be changed or refactored without affecting the public interface. This separation of concerns allows for greater flexibility in modifying the internal logic and behavior of the module or class, as long as the public contract remains unchanged.

## Debugging and Maintenance:

During debugging or maintenance, having private methods accessible within public methods can simplify the process of identifying and resolving issues. Developers can isolate and focus on specific sections of the code, making it easier to diagnose and fix problems.

## Enhanced Readability and Understandability:

By keeping the main logic in private methods and using public methods as entry points or coordinators, the code becomes more readable and easier to understand. Public methods serve as high-level abstractions, providing a clear overview of what the module or class does.

## Avoiding Unintended Modifications:

Restricting access to private methods helps prevent unintended modifications to the internal logic. Users are encouraged to use the intended public interface, reducing the risk of accidental misuse or alterations that could introduce bugs.

> **In summary, having access to private methods only within public methods promotes proper encapsulation, improves code maintainability, enhances security, and contributes to a clear separation of concerns within the module or class.**
